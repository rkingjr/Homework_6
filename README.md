## Homework 4: Coding Quiz

**Version 1.0**

# Description

This application allows the user to search for the current weather and 5-day forecast in a city of their choosing using the Open Weather APi.

When viewing current weather, the user is presented with the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and an icon representing the current weather conditions (rain, snow, sunny, partly cloudy, etc.).

When viewing the 5-day forecast, they are presented with another icon for the expected weather condition for the corresponding date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

Lastly, the user is presented with a list of their searched cities on the left and an option to clear that history.
